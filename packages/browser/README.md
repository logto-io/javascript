## What is this and how does it work?

As the name suggests, Logto browser SDK is the foundation of all Logto SDKs that run in a browser environment (Vanilla, React, Vue, etc.). `@logto/browser` extends `@logto/client` and provides a browser specific implementation of the client adapters:

* Implements `Storage` by using browser `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
* Implements `navigate` method by using `window.location.href`.

Usually you are not expected to use it directly in your application, but instead choosing a framework specific SDK that built on top of it. We have already released a set of official SDKs to accelerate your integration. [Check this out](https://docs.logto.io/sdk/) and get started!

If Logto does not support your front-end framework and you want to create your own SDK from scratch, we recommend checking out the [SDK convention](https://docs.logto.io/docs/references/sdk-convention/) first. You can also refer to our [React SDK](https://github.com/logto-io/js/tree/master/packages/react) and [Vue SDK](https://github.com/logto-io/js/tree/master/packages/vue) to learn more about the implementation details.
