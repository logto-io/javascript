remove commonjs export, fix non-default exports

- The CJS build generated by `@nuxt/module-builder` only exports the default export, causing issues for users who want to use named exports.
- Nuxt stills uses the CJS build if certain fields are found, regardless of the `"type": "module"` field in `package.json`. Since Nuxt 3 uses ESM by default, we just remove the CJS export to avoid confusion.
